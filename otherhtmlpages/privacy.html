We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
            <p>We have, and require our third-party service providers that receive Personal Information from us to have, a comprehensive written information security program that contains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for our respective physical facilities and in our respective computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are reasonably designed to protect information contained within such systems from loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>

            <p>Other Rights to Your Personal Information with Us Beyond your right to opt out of our processing Personal Information, you also have the option of exercising any of the below rights with respect to your Personal Information:</p>
            <p>Right to request Correction to your Personal Information We respect your wishes to correct inaccurate information and as such you must notify us of any change in your Personal Information. If you are a User, you can change some of your Personal Information by updating your PiggyVest account profile through our Services. Changes to financial details will require you to contact us directly. If you are not a User, you can contact us as indicated at the end of this Privacy Policy to make any changes or request on Personal Information we hold about you. Any changes will affect only future uses of your Personal Information and we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
            <p>Right to request Access to your Personal Information You can ask us whether we are storing your Personal Information, and you can ask to receive a copy of that Personal Information. Before sending you any Personal Information, we will ask you to provide proof of your identity. If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you any Personal Information. We will respond as quickly as we can to your requests for details of Personal Information we hold about you.</p>
            <p>Right to data portability In certain circumstances you can request to receive a copy of your Personal Information in a commonly used electronic format. This right only applies to Personal Information that you have provided to us (for example by completing a form or providing information through our Website). Information about you which has been gathered by monitoring your digital behaviour will also be subject to the right to data portability. The right to data portability only applies if the processing is based on your consent or if the Personal Information must be processed for the performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means (i.e., electronically).</p>
            <p>Right to request us to refrain from doing certain things with your data or restrict the extent of our collection or processing of your data. You may object to the processing of your Personal Information where you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
            <p>Right to request partial or complete erasure of your Personal Information. You may request for us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note however that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
            <p>Right to request the transfer of your Personal Information to another party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
            <p>Right to lodge a complaint with the Commission If you believe that the processing of your Personal Information violates data protection law, you also have the right to complain to the data protection supervisory authority, the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (“Commission”) website via the link: https://services.ndpc.gov.ng/breach/. Right to withdraw consent Where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information, you may withdraw your consent to the processing of Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We may advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
            <p>Right to object to decisions taken by automated means You have the right to object to decisions made solely based on automated processing of personal data, including profiling, that may have a legal effect on you.
